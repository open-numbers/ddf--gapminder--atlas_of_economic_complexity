Atlas of Economic Complexity

## Indicators

- pci        by product, year
- eci        by country, year
- coi        by country, year
- export_rca by product, country, year
- distance   by product, country, year
- cog        by product, country, year

There are 2 classification systems: HS and SITC. So all indicators
have 2 versions here.

## Definition of indicator

- pci: Product Complexity Index: How complex is this product? Is it
  relatively rare and produced by other diverse/complex countries?
- eci: Location Complexity Index: How complex is this country’s
  economy? Intuitively this is an average of the complexities of the
  products that a location produces.
- coi: Complexity Outlook Index: How well-positioned is this country
  in the product space? If you are nearby many potential unoccupied
  complex nodes, you get high COI. Often countries that are located in
  central / highly connected nodes.
- export_rca: Revealed Comparative Advantage: Does this country export
  this product more than its “fair share”? i.e. if the word export
  share of cars is 20% of all exports, and cars compose 40% of your
  country’s exports, cars have and RCA of 2, i.e. your country exports
  twice its “fair share” of cars. We say that a country’s produces a
  product significantly if it has RCA > 1. If a product has RCA <1 for
  that country, we consider that a potential new product. The
  feasibility graph you linked us to focuses specifically only on RCA
  < 1 products.
- distance: How far away is this potential product from my country’s
  current productive capabilities?
- cog: Complexity Outlook Gain: How would adding this new product
  change my complexity outlook? Would it connect me to many new
  high-complexity nodes?
